	 * When coming out of u-boot rather than downloading the Zephyr binary
	 * via JTAG, a few things modified by u-boot have to be re-set to a
	 * suitable default value for Zephyr to run, namely:
	 *
	 * - u-boot places the exception vectors somewhere in RAM and then
	 *   lets the VBAR register point to them. Zephyr uses the default
	 *   vector table location at address zero (and maybe at some later
	 *   time alternatively the HIVECS position). If VBAR isn't reset
	 *   to zero, the system crashes during the first context switch when
	 *   SVC is invoked.
	 * - u-boot sets the following bits in the SCTLR register:
	 *   - [I] ICache enable
	 *   - [C] DCache enable
	 *   - [Z] Branch prediction enable
	 *   - [A] Enforce strict alignment enable
	 *   [I] and [C] will be enabled during the MMU init -> disable them
	 *   until then. [Z] is probably not harmful. [A] will cause a crash
	 *   as early as z_mem_manage_init when an unaligned access is performed
	 *   -> clear [A].
