      This array provides the state of GPIO pin set when requesting it from
      the gpio controller.

    description: Selection of available voltages provided by this regulator and
      matching GPIO configurations to achieve them. If there are no states in
      the "states" array, use a fixed regulator instead. First value in an array
      item is voltage in microvolts and the second is GPIO group state value.
